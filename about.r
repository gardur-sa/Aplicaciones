What is BMI?

Body Mass Index (BMI) is essentially a value obtained from the weight and height of a person [1].
Calculating the BMI

BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (kg) by their squared height (m) as follows:

    BMI = kg/m^2

where kg represents the person's weight and m^2 the person's squared height.
